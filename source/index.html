    Hello my future girlfriend, my name is Derrick Staples. I enjoy playing with
    code, climbing on things I should not, running, caster-boarding, and twirling
    things around like a baton girl on a cheerleading squad.<br><br>
    atinybird is mostly just an experiment and file dump; there is not much here
    with fleshed out content. If anything seems remotely interesting however,
    please feel free to <a href="/cheep.html">contact me</a>.
